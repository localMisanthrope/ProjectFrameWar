[h1]WARFRAME, The Mod[/h1]

Developed by local_misanthrope.

Delivers the world of Warframe to you.

[h2]FRAME CONSTRUCTION[/h2]
Each frame is crafted with three parts, the Chassis, Neuroptics and Systems.
Equipping a frame enables you to modify it with special Frame Modules.

[h2]MODS[/h2]
Modding has been simplified to a few items which function similarly like accessories. Collect them all!

[h2]CONTENT DEVIATION DISCLAIMER[/h2]
This mod deviates heavily from the systems Warframe has imposed. This was done to make systems more simplistic and better refined for a Terraria context.
This mod also alters the base game to enable it to function properly in the world.
If things look and feel different, [b]they probably are[/b]!

[h2]COMPATIBILITY DISCLAIMER[/h2]
At this time, I will not be considering compatibility with any mods. If you would like to enable this, consider supporting it yourself through modpacks.
As for companion and addon mods, I am working on facilitating cross-mod capabilities. Stay tuned!
