[h1]WARFRAME, The Mod[/h1]

Developed by local_misanthrope.

Delivers the world of Warframe to you.

[h2]FRAME CONSTRUCTION[/h2]
Find the blueprints for each Warframe component and construct them in a special Defense event!
Available Warframes;
- Excalibur
- Mag
- Volt

[h2]RELICS[/h2]
Locate Void Relics and construct an Orokin Reactor.
Relics can be cracked with the Orokin Reactor. Be wary, Void Fissures will ravage your world!
Your reward is a piece of Prime gear from a set pool!

[h2]DISCLAIMER[/h2]
This mod deviates heavily from the systems Warframe has imposed. 
This was done to make systems more simplistic and better refined for a Terraria context.
If things look different, they probably are!
