[h1]WARFRAME, The Mod[/h1]

Developed by local_misanthrope.

Delivers the world of Warframe to you.

[h2]FRAME CONSTRUCTION[/h2]
Each frame is crafted with three parts, the Chassis, Neuroptics and Systems.
Equipping a frame enables you to modify it with special Frame Modules.

[h2]MODS[/h2]
Modding has been simplified to a few items which function similarly like accessories. Collect them all!

[h2]CONTENT DEVIATION DISCLAIMER[/h2]
This mod deviates heavily from the systems Warframe has imposed. This was done to make systems more simplistic and better refined for a Terraria context.
This mod also alters the base game to enable it to function properly in the world.
If things look and feel different, [b]they probably are[/b]!

[h2]COMPATIBILITY DISCLAIMER[/h2]
At this time, I will not be considering compatibility with any mods. If you would like to enable this, consider supporting it yourself through modpacks.
As for companion and addon mods, I am working on facilitating cross-mod capabilities. Stay tuned!

[h2]MULTIPLAYER DISCLAIMER[/h2]
This mod is slated to be a Singleplayer mod; meaning networking and Multiplayer will come in patches much later in development.
Playing this mod in Multiplayer is bound to be riddled with bugs to potentially game breaking crashes.
You have been warned ahead of time!
